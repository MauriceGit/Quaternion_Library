# Quaternion_Library

This repository is all about the files: **quaternions.h** and **quaternions.c**.

They represent an interface (library) of Quaternions and the most common operations on a Quaternion.

Corresponding to the library, I wrote a small sample program, that rotates a simple geometry around a fixed axis
with Quaternions. It is used for all calculations of the new rotated position.

# ToDo:

When I have some spare time, I will eliminate the imageloader and replace it with my own.
From this point on, this sample and library will be Open Source and free to use and distribute.
